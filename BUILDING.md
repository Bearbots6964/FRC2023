# Building
## Prerequisites
### WPILib
Make sure you have the 2023 version of WPILib installed. You can get it [here](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/tag/v2023.1.1); download the release for your omputer's operating system. If you are using a school Mac, you probably need the arm64 version.
### Visual Studio Code
While WPILib technically has a instance of Visual Studio Code, you can use an existing one. 
#### Windows
On Windows, open a new Explorer window, go to This PC and to C:, then navigate to `Users/public/wpilib/2023/vsCodeExtensions`, and drag each file to Visual Studio Code in the Extensions pane. Follow the instructions it gives you.
#### Mac
On Mac, go to your user folder. You can do this by hitting `CTRL + Shift + G` and typing a squiggly: `~` and hitting Enter. Go to wpilib (A/N: might be a year number after it?) and go to vsCodeExtensions and following the rest of the instructions above.
#### Linux
If you're a Linux user, you know enough about computers to figure this out.
### Git
Get Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow the instructions.
### GitHub
Make sure you have an account on GitHub. When you sign up, ***MAKE SURE YOU USE YOUR SCHOOL EMAIL.*** I really cannot emphasize this enough. Send your email in the GroupMe and wait for me to invite you as a collaborator.
#### GitHub Student Developer Pack (optional)
You can get free stuff by signing up for
